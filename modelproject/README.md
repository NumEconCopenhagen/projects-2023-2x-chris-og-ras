# Model analysis project

Our project is titled **Model-Solow** and is about two different solow models where they are being combined to the final model, where we will look at the difference.

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [modelproject.ipynb](modelproject.ipynb).

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires no further packages.
