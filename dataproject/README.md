# Data analysis project

Our project is titled **Dataproject** and is about finding the correlation between the import of beer to Denmark and how many sun hours there is per month.

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [dataproject.ipynb](dataproject.ipynb).

We apply the **following datasets**:

1. Import of beer data (*DST*) 
2. Temperature data (*DMI*)

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires the following installations:
- matplotlib-venn ``pip install matplotlib-venn``
- dstapi ``pip install git+https://github.com/alemartinello/dstapi``
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Datetime
- Requests
- Requests.auth
- Tqdm
- Pprint
