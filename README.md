This repository contains  
1. Inaugural project. 
2. Data project. We fetch data from **DST** on **import of beer** and we also fetch data from **DMI** on **the temperatur**. We then look at how them import of beer in Denmark correlates with the temperature in Denmark, where we can see that there is a strong correlation.
3. Model project. We model two different solow models, and look on how they evolve in GDP pr. worker, and their steady state values. After this we merge these two models together to see how it reacts and how the steady state is. We then look at how the three different models react to the different parameters.
4. Exam project.
